       Christmas is a Christian holiday that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. 
        Christmas is also a cultural holiday for many non-Christians.<br>
        Christmas is celebrated on the 25th day of December.
       
        It is one of the most important days of the year for Christians.<br>
        
       The Christmas season (called Christmastide) ends 6 January, also called the Twelfth Day of Christmas. On this day, Christians celebrate Epiphany.
       People celebrate Christmas in many places around the world. Some people celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday.<br>Christmas traditions are different in different countries. However, they almost always include a feast; giving gifts or cards; and enjoying church or public festivities, like singing Christmas carols and songs.
       The idea of Santa Claus is based on Saint Nicholas, a 4th-century Christian saint.
       In the Northern Hemisphere, Christmastide happens during the winter.

        Among Christian festivals and holidays, Christmas remains the most popular. ... The word “Christmas” is actually a combination of two words “Christ,” a title given to Jesus, and “mass" that means celebration. In essence, Christmas simply is the celebration of the birth of Jesus.<br>
         Christians began to see the secularization of the celebration day of the birth of Christ as the shift toward<br>Santa Claus and gift exchanging replaced the celebration of the advent of Christ<br>
       and giving to the poor and needy without expectation of receiving anything in return.
